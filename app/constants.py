    "I grew up below the poverty line; I didn't have as much as other people did. I think it made me stronger as a person, it built my character. Now I have a 4.0 grade point average and I want to go to college, and just become a better person.",
    "No one can stop me.",

    "I'm looking forward to influencing others in a positive way. My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it.",
    "It's not me trying to act or pose in a certain way. It's a lifestyle - like a suaveness or a swag, per se.",

    "I think I'm probably gonna quit music.",

They climbed in and hid. When the guys working on the truck started getting the garbage they found them straight away. It was crazy.",
    "I've had a few gigs where things have got out of hand and there has been a huge crush with my fans. They are important and I don't want them being hurt. They are a mad crowd.",

    "I'm happy with the man I'm becoming.",
    "Cheryl Cole and Katy Perry are two of the hottest girls in the world - and so normal and funny with it. If I was a few years older they are the kind of girls I'd like to date. I want a younger version of Cheryl and Katy - a mixture of the two would be hot.",
    "Canada's the best country in the world."
